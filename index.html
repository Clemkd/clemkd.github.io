        <h1>PostgreSQL aggregate table invalidation tip</h1>
        <p>
            We have a time-based serie table "raws" where our device records are saved one by one.

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Column</th>
                    <th>Type</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>device</td>
                    <td>text</td>
                    <td>Device unique id</td>    
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>time</td>
                    <td>timestamptz</td>
                    <td>Record time</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>value</td>
                    <td>int4</td>
                    <td>Value recorded</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <br/>
            This table have a huge amount of record in it (~20 000 000).
            Calculate the sum or the average of "value" for each device and time 
            take more than 2 minutes to proceed, even if we use indexes well.
            In that way, it is necessary to calculate the result which will be invalidated 
            for each action on the "raws" table (insert, update, delete).

            <br/>
            We create a daily aggregate table named "raws_daily_aggregate" to store results by device and by day :
            
            <br/>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Column</th>
                    <th>Type</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>device</td>
                    <td>text</td>
                    <td>Device unique id</td>    
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>day</td>
                    <td>date</td>
                    <td>Day of group</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>values_sum</td>
                    <td>int4</td>
                    <td>Sum of all values of the device in the specified day</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>updated_at</td>
                    <td>timestamptz</td>
                    <td>Last update timestamp of that group</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <br/>
            When "updated_at" column is null, "values_sum" is invalid and must be (re)calculated.
            A cron job must be created to update aggregate table. This job will calculate "values_sum" of each
            record where "updated_at" column is null. It avoids to calculate all device/day pairs if it is not necessary.

            <br/>
            Now, we have to create the function which will set "updated_at" to null when actions are done in the "raws" table.

            <code>
                CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION invalidate_daily_aggregate_part()
                RETURNS TRIGGER 
                LANGUAGE PLPGSQL
                AS
                $$
                DECLARE
                    x_rec record;
                BEGIN
                    insert into raws_daily_aggregate ("device", "day", "updated_at") 
                    select distinct on ("device", "day") "device", "day", null from _table
                    on conflict ("device", "day") do update set "updated_at" = null;

                    RETURN NULL;
                END;
                $$;
            </code>

            <br/>
            This function must be called after each statement :
            <br/>
            <code>
                create or replace TRIGGER invalidate_daily_aggregate_part_insert_trigger
                AFTER INSERT ON public.raws
                REFERENCING NEW TABLE AS _table
                FOR EACH STATEMENT
                EXECUTE PROCEDURE public.invalidate_daily_aggregate_part();

                create or replace TRIGGER invalidate_daily_aggregate_part_update_trigger
                AFTER UPDATE ON public.raws
                REFERENCING NEW TABLE AS _table
                FOR EACH STATEMENT
                EXECUTE PROCEDURE public.invalidate_daily_aggregate_part();

                create or replace TRIGGER invalidate_daily_aggregate_part_delete_trigger
                AFTER DELETE ON public.raws
                REFERENCING OLD TABLE AS _table
                FOR EACH STATEMENT
                EXECUTE PROCEDURE public.invalidate_daily_aggregate_part();
            </code>
        </p>
